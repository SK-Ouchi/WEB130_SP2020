            <p>
                My name is Joshua (or Josh&mdash;I go by either) Wedekind, and I am the professor for WEB 130!
                I spend most of my weekdays coding for Microsoft. When I'm not coding for work, I often work on side 
                projects&mdash;dreams really&mdash;or learn new things to keep up with tech. Lately I've been working 
                on a coffee tasting notes app for iOS. (SwiftUI is awesome).

                I grew up in the Midwest, but I'm now entrenched in the Pacific Northwest. I love pine trees more than is natural.
                The scent brings back fond childhood memories. I plan on staying in the PNW for a while.

                    Hiking! Or just being outdoors in the beautiful PNW. I never saw mountains growing up, so now I take every opportunity 
                    to go out to the mountains and hike.
                    The recent closures of the parking lots around popular trails is a real bummer.

                    While the parking lot and restroom is closed, there is still plenty of street parking nearby.

                    I am a huge retro tech fan. No, I don't own the Altair 8800, but I've gotten dangerously close to buying the clone that 
                    was made a few years ago.

                    I can't remember how it all started, but I own a small collection, including:

                        <li>Apple IIe</li>
